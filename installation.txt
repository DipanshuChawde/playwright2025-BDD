🧪 Playwright installation ---------------------------------
    🟩 Nodejs

    📝 VS Code

    📁 Create project folder → open in VSCode

    💻 Install Playwright using terminal
    npm init playwright@latest
        📦 package.json → Node project management file
        ⚙️ playwright.config.js → Playwright configuration
        🧪 tests → We can run all the Playwright tests

🔍 npm playwright -v → Returns installed version of Playwright

🧩 Install Playwright using VS Code extension

▶️ Run the Playwright test
    npx playwright test
    npx playwright test --headed
    npx playwright show-report       

✅ Playwright-BDD Installation & Setup Guide -------------------------------------------

🧩 	Step 1: Install Required Libraries
	1.	Run the following commands in your terminal:
•	npm i -D playwright-bdd          
 # BDD wrapper for Playwright
•	npm i -D @cucumber/cucumber@latest  
# Cucumber core library (used internally by playwright-bdd)

	2.	Check package.json for both packages under devDependencies
	3.	Optionally, install "Cucumber (Gherkin)" extension in VS Code for .feature file support.
	
🗂️	Step 2: Update playwright.config.js
	1.	Import the BDD configuration helper:
import { defineBddConfig } from 'playwright-bdd';

	2.	Set your BDD test directories:
const testDir = defineBddConfig({
  paths: ['tests/features/*.feature'],       // Path to your .feature files
  require: ['tests/steps/*.spec.js'],       // Path to your step definition files
});

	3.	Export the config:
      Update the export section to use the BDD config:
export default defineConfig({
  ...testDir, // 👈 Use the BDD config instead of manually setting testDir
  // You can also add more Playwright config options here
});

	
🧪	Step 3: Write Your First Feature File
	1.	Create a file: tests/features/myFirstBdd.feature

Feature: Google Search
Scenario: Search for Playwright
Given I am on the Google search page
When I search for "Playwright"
Then I should see results

	

🧠	Step 4: Generate Step Template with bddgen
	1.	Run the following command to auto-generate step templates:
npx bddgen

	2.	This will output sample code in the console.
💡 Copy it into a file: tests/steps/myFirstBdd.steps.js

	
🧾	Step 5: Add Step Definitions
	1.	In your step file (e.g., myFirstBdd.steps.js), use this base:

import { expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { createBdd } from 'playwright-bdd';
const { Given, When, Then } = createBdd();

Given('I am on the Google search page', async ({ page }) => {
await page.goto('https://www.google.com');
});

When('I search for {string}', async ({ page }, searchTerm) => {
await page locator('[name="q"]').fill(searchTerm);
await page.keyboard.press('Enter');
});

Then('I should see results', async ({ page }) => {
await page waitForSelector('#search');
const results = await page.locator('#search .g').count();
expect(results).toBeGreaterThan(O);

});

	
▶️	Step 6: Run the BDD Test
	1.	Run this command to execute the feature file using Playwright
npx bddgen; npx playwright test 1.myFirstEx.feature --headed --project=chromium
Or
npx playwright test 1.myFirstEx.feature --headed --project=chromium

	2.	Or simply run: 
npx playwright test

	
🎉	You're Done!
	You've now integrated BDD using playwright-bdd with Playwright’s native test runner.
